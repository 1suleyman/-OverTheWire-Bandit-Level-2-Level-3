# -OverTheWire-Bandit-Level-2-Level-3
In this short lab I completed Bandit Level 2 → Level 3. The goal was to find the password for Level 3 stored in a file whose name begins with dashes and includes spaces (--spaces in this filename--) in the home directory, then use that password to proceed to the next level.
